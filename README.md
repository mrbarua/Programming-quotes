### Pro advice: Don't learn programming languages based on trends. Learn them based on what you aim/need to do. If you plan to build a mobile app, learn Java, Kotlin, Objective-C or Swift. If you plan to build a web app, learn JavaScript. If you plan to use Machine Learning, learn Python, etc. This is how it works.
